ðŸš€ Overcoming Challenges and Building Features: A Developerâ€™s Journey

ðŸŒŸ Challenges Faced

Lazy Loading Background Images: Couldnâ€™t lazy-load the landing page background image using background(url) in CSS.
Login Notifications: Initial notification alerts triggered for all login attempts (successful or failed). Eventually resolved using an alternative approach.
Custom Styles Over Bootstrap: Skipped Bootstrap due to limited color options, crafted custom styles instead.
Edit Functionality Lag: Editing required a page refresh to reflect changes. Plan to incorporate React for state management.

ðŸ›  Features Implemented:___  
User Authentication: Secure registration and login processes.
Persistent Lists: User lists remain intact even after logout.
Full CRUD Support: Edit and delete lists seamlessly.
User Verification: Check if a user exists before login.

Enhanced Security Measures:____
Passwords hashed across client-server-database.
Log out from all devices functionality.
Rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks.
Account activation via any email provider.
Pagination: Displays 5 lists at a time for better user experience.

ðŸ’¡ Lessons Learned & Hacks__
Authentication Models: Explored both JWT-based token auth and session-based auth with cookies.
Async in Node.js: Leveraged async functions to manage database interactions efficiently.
